The Ulm Security Sparrows invite all hackers, security interested students and all other creatures in the area of Ulm to join us solving riddles and breaking IT security challenges.

[TU-CTF](http://ctf.asciioverflow.com/) is an introductory CTF offering challenges the categories like reversing, web, crypto, exploitation and others.

The orga team ASCIIOverflow announced the event to start on Friday midnight and end after 48h on Sunday. We will gather in the O27/Linuxpool between 12 and 1pm on Saturday and decide when we show up on Sunday on sight. Night owls are of course welcomed to start the night before. Orga related information and CTF coordination is done through our [CTF-mailinglist](https://imap.uni-ulm.de/lists/subscribe/ctf). If your not subscribed yet, it's time to [do](https://imap.uni-ulm.de/lists/subscribe/ctf) so.

See you on Saturday!
